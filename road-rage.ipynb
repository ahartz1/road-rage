    "# Road Rage: Finding the Ideal Speed Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "* Drivers want to go up to 120 km/hr.\n",
    "* The average car is 5 meters long.\n",
    "* Drivers want at least a number of meters equal to their speed in meters/second between them and the next car.\n",
    "* Drivers will accelerate 2 m/s<sup>2</sup> up to their desired speed as long as they have room to do so.\n",
    "* If another car is too close, drivers will match that car's speed until they have room again.\n",
    "* If a driver would hit another car by continuing, they stop.\n",
    "* Drivers will randomly (10% chance each second) slow by 2 m/s.\n",
    "* This section of road is one lane going one way.\n",
    "* Assume that drivers enter the road at the speed they left.\n",
    "* Simulation starts with 30 cars per kilometer, evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normal Mode\n",
    "We have a 1 kilometer section of road being built and do not know what the speed limit should be. This notebook simulates the 1 kilometer of road. Even though this road is not circular, the simulation treats it as such in order to generate a continuous flow of traffic."
